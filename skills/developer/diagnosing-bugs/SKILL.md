# Diagnosing Bugs

A discipline for hard bugs. Choose the phases that resolve the actual uncertainty; a clear local defect may need only inspection and one focused check.

## Scope and completion

For diagnosis-only requests, inspect code, logs, and safe reproductions, then report the cause or ranked possibilities with evidence and remaining uncertainty. Do not enter the fix phase or modify project artifacts unless the user requests a fix. Temporary probes must fit the authorized scope; production instrumentation requires authorization.

For requested fixes, continue through correction, proportionate regression checks, and cleanup. Preserve complex-bug reproduction and verification when they are needed to establish correctness.

When exploring the codebase, read `CONTEXT.md` (if it exists) to get a clear mental model of the relevant modules, and check ADRs in the area you're touching.

## Phase 1 — Build a feedback loop

Prefer a focused pass/fail signal that exercises the user's exact symptom. Use it to distinguish causes and verify a requested fix. Code inspection and existing logs can help design that signal.

Invest in a repeatable signal in proportion to the bug's uncertainty and impact. Do not spend longer building infrastructure than the investigation warrants.

### Ways to construct one — try them in roughly this order

1. **Failing test** at whatever seam reaches the bug — unit, integration, e2e.
2. **Curl / HTTP script** against a running dev server.
3. **CLI invocation** with a fixture input, diffing stdout against a known-good snapshot.
4. **Headless browser script** (Playwright / Puppeteer) — drives the UI, asserts on DOM/console/network.
5. **Replay a captured trace.** Save a real network request / payload / event log to disk; replay it through the code path in isolation.
6. **Throwaway harness.** Spin up a minimal subset of the system (one service, mocked deps) that exercises the bug code path with a single function call.
7. **Property / fuzz loop.** For intermittent wrong output, choose a bounded input budget and record the seed and observed failures.
8. **Bisection harness.** If the bug appeared between two known states (commit, dataset, version), automate "boot at state X, check, repeat" so you can `git bisect run` it.
9. **Differential loop.** Run the same input through old-version vs new-version (or two configs) and diff outputs.
10. **HITL bash script.** Last resort. If a human must click, drive _them_ with `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh` so the loop is still structured. Captured output feeds back to you.

Choose a loop that can distinguish the suspected failure from unrelated failures.

### Tighten the loop

Treat the loop as a product. Once you have _a_ loop, **tighten** it:

- Can I make it faster? (Cache setup, skip unrelated init, narrow the test scope.)
- Can I make the signal sharper? (Assert on the specific symptom, not "didn't crash".)
- Can I make it more deterministic? (Pin time, seed RNG, isolate filesystem, freeze network.)

A 30-second flaky loop is barely better than no loop; a 2-second deterministic one is tight — a debugging superpower.

### Non-deterministic bugs

Measure the reproduction rate and record trial counts. Use bounded repetitions, stress, controlled timing, or seeds when appropriate; stop at the agreed resource limit. Rare failures remain useful evidence, but absence of failure is not proof of a fix.

### When you genuinely cannot build a loop

State what could not be reproduced and what you tried. Continue safe inspection of available code and captured artifacts, distinguishing confirmed facts from hypotheses. Ask for environment access, a captured artifact, or production instrumentation only when needed to resolve the remaining uncertainty. Do not claim a confirmed root cause or verified fix without supporting evidence.

### Completion criterion — a tight loop that goes red

Phase 1 is done when the loop is **tight** and **red-capable**: you can name **one command** — a script path, a test invocation, a curl — that you have **already run at least once** (paste the invocation and its output), and that is:

- [ ] **Red-capable** — it drives the actual bug code path and asserts the **user's exact symptom**, so it can go red on this bug and green once fixed. Not "runs without erroring" — it must be able to _catch this specific bug_.
- [ ] **Deterministic** — same verdict every run (flaky bugs: a pinned, high reproduction rate, per above).
- [ ] **Fast** — seconds, not minutes.
- [ ] **Agent-runnable** — you can run it unattended; a human in the loop only via `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh`.

These criteria describe a runnable reproduction when feasible. If environment access or intermittency prevents one, document the evidence and limitation and continue only the investigation that evidence supports.

## Phase 2 — Reproduce + minimise

Run the loop. Watch it go red — the bug appears.

Confirm:

- [ ] The loop produces the failure mode the **user** described — not a different failure that happens to be nearby. Wrong bug = wrong fix.
- [ ] The failure is reproducible across multiple runs (or, for non-deterministic bugs, reproducible at a high enough rate to debug against).
- [ ] You have captured the exact symptom (error message, wrong output, slow timing) so later phases can verify the fix actually addresses it.

### Minimise

Once it's red, shrink the repro to the **smallest scenario that still goes red**. Cut inputs, callers, config, data, and steps **one at a time**, re-running the loop after each cut — keep only what's load-bearing for the failure.

Why bother: a minimal repro shrinks the hypothesis space in Phase 3 (fewer moving parts left to suspect) and becomes the clean regression test in Phase 5.

Minimisation is sufficient when the relevant trigger is isolated enough to distinguish causes and support verification.

Avoid further minimisation when it no longer changes the diagnosis or verification decision.

## Phase 3 — Hypothesise

Generate as many falsifiable hypotheses as the evidence warrants. Consider alternatives when the cause is uncertain; do not invent extra hypotheses for an already demonstrated local defect.

Each hypothesis must be **falsifiable**: state the prediction it makes.

> Format: "If <X> is the cause, then <changing Y> will make the bug disappear / <changing Z> will make it worse."

If you cannot state the prediction, the hypothesis is a vibe — discard or sharpen it.

**Show the ranked list to the user before testing.** They often have domain knowledge that re-ranks instantly ("we just deployed a change to #3"), or know hypotheses they've already ruled out. Cheap checkpoint, big time saver. Don't block on it — proceed with your ranking if the user is AFK.

## Phase 4 — Instrument

Each probe must map to a specific prediction from Phase 3. **Change one variable at a time.**

Tool preference:

1. **Debugger / REPL inspection** if the env supports it. One breakpoint beats ten logs.
2. **Targeted logs** at the boundaries that distinguish hypotheses.
3. Never "log everything and grep".

**Tag every debug log** with a unique prefix, e.g. `[DEBUG-a4f2]`. Cleanup at the end becomes a single grep. Untagged logs survive; tagged logs die.

**Perf branch.** For performance regressions, logs are usually wrong. Instead: establish a baseline measurement (timing harness, `performance.now()`, profiler, query plan), then bisect. Measure first, fix second.

## Phase 5 — Requested fix + regression test

Enter this phase only when the user has authorized a fix. A diagnosis-only task is complete after reporting the evidence and uncertainty.

Write the regression test **before the fix** — but only if there is a **correct seam** for it.

A correct seam is one where the test exercises the **real bug pattern** as it occurs at the call site. If the only available seam is too shallow (single-caller test when the bug needs multiple callers, unit test that can't replicate the chain that triggered the bug), a regression test there gives false confidence.

**If no correct seam exists, that itself is the finding.** Note it. The codebase architecture is preventing the bug from being locked down. Flag this for the next phase.

If a correct seam exists:

1. Turn the minimised repro into a failing test at that seam.
2. Watch it fail.
3. Apply the fix.
4. Watch it pass.
5. Re-run the Phase 1 feedback loop against the original (un-minimised) scenario.

## Phase 6 — Cleanup + post-mortem

Required before declaring done:

- [ ] Original repro no longer reproduces (re-run the Phase 1 loop)
- [ ] Regression test passes (or absence of seam is documented)
- [ ] All `[DEBUG-...]` instrumentation removed (`grep` the prefix)
- [ ] Throwaway prototypes deleted (or moved to a clearly-marked debug location)
- [ ] The hypothesis that turned out correct is stated in the commit / PR message — so the next debugger learns

If the evidence reveals a recurring architectural cause, describe it as a follow-up with concrete examples. Do not start a separate architecture refactor without authorization.
